# NUTSHELL
Named after the Q (Supply) Staff Callsign, NUTSHELL is a simplistic to use, but powerfully capable mod manager in a... well, you get it. It is cross-compatible with ArmA3Sync one of the most popular ArmA mod managers out there, aiming only to simplify the end-user experience and to boost performance where possible. It is primarily designed to work with TWC only at this time, but there is no delibrate design decision made to lock it down, and would be plausable to open it up to others in the future.

## Setup / Configuration
One of the big headaches with ArmA3Sync is the initial set up process, it's too feature rich for the vast majority of use cases, and by extension has a non-intuitive UI. In addition, it is daunting to use for those new to modding in general, and easy to make mistakes with that require experienced users to help them. It's also possible for many users to inadvertently launch without updating mods, causing frustration - which is exactly counter to what one wants from gaming with friends.

### NUTSHELL aims to reduce the vast majority of these problems, by a few means. 
1) First, the initial (skippable) set up process will be very guiding and as simple to use as possible, with many additional options for power users that are tucked away, but not hidden. It will also where possible prefill boxes with best guesses (for example registry scan for the ArmA path).
2) Second, through the introduction of a community META file system, communities can easily CRUD repos, release information and some client customisation to the experience, without the need of repackaging and distrubuting a seperate executable. 
3) Third, a thorough and tightly integrated notification system for updates, that isn't intrusive to gaming experiences, but intrusive enough to not be missed (with fair customisation, as this is very subjective).
